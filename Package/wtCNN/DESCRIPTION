Description: wtCNN combines wavelet analysis with convolutional neural networks for detection of regime shifts in time series data. Wavelet power analysis is sensitive to multiple leading indicators of regime shifts, including changes in variance and autocorrelation, producing images of wavelet power as a function of time and timescale (frequency). Convolutional neural networks are adept at image classification. The package contains two main workflows: classifying whether a regime shift occurred in a whole time series; and a sliding-window analysis to detect impending regime shifts. The former was shown to have >90% accuracy in tests using simulated data; the latter is unproven.
